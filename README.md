# Flask By Example Tutorial

This repo hosts my work from the following tutorial: https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/.

The tutorial walks you through building a Flask app that calculates word-frequency pairs from a given site. Aside from Flask, you also get hands on with Postgres, SQLAlchemy, Redis and Angular.
